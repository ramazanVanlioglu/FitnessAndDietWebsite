In this project, I've tried to illustrute that how a fitness and diet website works, proceses data, handles login and register section and controlls users diet and training program. In this project. Users can send messages to the admins via contact section, and admins can see them the informations such as when the message was sent, sent by who, and its content. Admins also can see the users fitness and diet programs as in rows and columns. Users can see their BMI and calorie calculation by typing their height(cm) and weight(kg).
